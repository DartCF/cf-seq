9/24/19,GSE131505,Sustained reprioritization of metabolic pathways is associated with persistence and biofilm formation in non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae,"We used an in vitro evolved strain of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) to examine the metabolic contributions to persistence RNASeq analysis identified 55 transcripts that significantly changed in amount within in vitro biofilms formed by RM33, as compared to the parental strain. Expression of genes encoding all enzymes within the tryptophan and glycogen pathways was significantly increased in biofilms formed by RM33 and the parental strains. In addition, increases were observed in metabolite transport, adhesin production and DNA metabolism, while we observed pyruvate ato have a pivotal role in the metabolic pathways associated with persistence.","86-028NP, RM33 - Persister",DIS,NA,NA,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131505
