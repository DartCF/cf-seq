2021/10/24,GSE186376,"Porphyromonas gingivalis W83:Transcriptome profiling and functional verification of flavodoxin","The aim of the study was to identify the role of flavodoxin gene in the virulence of P. gingivalis W83.The mRNA profiles of P. gingivalis W83 and flavodoxin mutant strain were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina sequencing platform. Differential expression analysis of two groups (Three biological replicates per group) was performed using the DESeq R package. In total, 376 genes met the DEGs criteria (194 upregulated genes and 182 down-regulated genes). The KEGG pathway analysis indicated the DEGs were significantly enriched in three KEGG pathways, comprising pathways associated with Peroxisome, Two-component system and Quorum sensing.Importantly, we found that the flavodoxin gene can regulate the type IX secretion system and oxidative stress system in P. gingivalis W83. The knowledge obtained will help us to deeply understand the role of flavodoxin gene in the P. gingivalis W83 genome.",W83,BHI,NA,NA,Porphyromonas gingivalis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE186376
