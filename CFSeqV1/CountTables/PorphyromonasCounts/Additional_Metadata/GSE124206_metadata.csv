12/21/18,GSE124206,Comparison of Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 gene expression when grown with or without galactose,"Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) W83 cultures in early exponential phase were supplemented with 0.1% galactose or vehicle control. The cultures were then permitted to grow anaerobically at 37°C for 3 hours, which corresponds to approximately one doubling of P. gingivalis. At this point, RNA extraction was performed using the cultures, and these samples were processed and submitted for RNA sequencing using an Illumina platform. Modest changes in gene expression were observed between cultures grown with or without galactose, and the majority of changes were associated with processes occurring at the cell membrane.",W83,Tryptic soy broth,Galactose,NA,Porphyromonas gingivalis,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE124206
