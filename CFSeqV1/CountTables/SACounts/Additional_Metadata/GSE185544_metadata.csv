2022/10/08,GSE185544,"Evolution of hypervirulence during bloodstream adaptation of CA-MRSA strain USA300","The epidemic community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) clone USA300 has recently become a leading cause of hospital-associated bloodstream infections (BSI). Leveraging this recent introduction into hospitals and the limited genetic variation across the USA300 strains, we combined microbial comparative genomics with phenotypic analyses to discover adaptive mutations. USA300 isolates from BSI were found to have independently evolved single nucleotide variants in the transcriptional regulator sarZ. sarZ inactivation lead to altered expression of virulence factors, resulting in increased lethality in a murine model of BSI. Thus, USA300 strains can optimize their fitness in hospitals through evolution of higher virulence.",USA300,TSB,NA,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185544
