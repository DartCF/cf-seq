In this work, we explore the responses triggered by the encounter between two common throat bacteria, S. aureus and S. anginosus, in the presence of human tonsillar epithelial cells. We performed an in vitro coculture experiment followed by RNA sequencing. A total of 332 and 279 significant DEGs with p-value &lt; 0.05 and Log2 fold change &gt; |2| were identified after 1 h and 3 h of post-infection, respectively. Our study identified several transcripts in S. aureus that might be important when facing a potential competitor during throat colonization. These transcripts may be useful in the development of treatments against S. aureus throat colonization and could be further investigated to better understand their roles in the immune response.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE234900
