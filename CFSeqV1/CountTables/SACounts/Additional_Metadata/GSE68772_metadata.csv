6/1/15,GSE68772,The C-terminal region of the RNA helicase CshA is required for the interaction with the degradosome and turnover of bulk RNA in the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus.,"Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile opportunistic pathogen that adapts readily to a variety of different growth conditions. This adaptation requires a rapid regulation of gene expression including the control of mRNA abundance. The CshA DEAD-box RNA helicase was previously shown to be required for efficient turnover of the agr quorum sensing mRNA. Here we show by transcriptome-wide RNA sequencing and microarray analyses that CshA is required for the degradation of bulk mRNA. Moreover a subset of mRNAs is significantly stabilised in absence of CshA. Deletion of the C-terminal extension affects RNA turnover similar to the full deletion of the cshA gene. In accordance with RNA decay data, the C-terminal region of CshA is required for an RNA-independent interaction with components of the RNA degradation machinery. The C-terminal truncation of CshA reduces its ATPase activity and this reduction cannot be compensated at high RNA concentrations. Finally, the deletion of the C-terminal extension does affect growth at low temperatures, but to a significantly lesser degree than the full deletion, indicating that the core of the helicase can assume a partial function and opening the possibility that CshA is involved in different cellular processes.",PR01,Mueller Hinton Broth ,Rifampicin,Delta-CshA,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68772
