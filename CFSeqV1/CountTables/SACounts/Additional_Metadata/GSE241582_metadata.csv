2023/08/28,GSE241582,"Exploring modulation in Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation and virulence during platelet storage and its impact on platelet functionality","Staphylococcus aureus CBS2016-05 and PS/BAC/317/16/W were spiked (4E+06 CFU/ml) into platelet concentrates (PCs) and Trypticase soy broth (TSB) and allowed to grow until early stationary phase (6 days) at 22-24°C. Subsequently, the cells were pelleted at 4°C and subjected to RNA extraction using the miRNeasy Mini Kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. To eliminate genomic DNA, the RNA samples from three independent biological replicates were treated with TURBO™ DNase AmbionTM (Thermo Fisher Scientific).",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE241582
