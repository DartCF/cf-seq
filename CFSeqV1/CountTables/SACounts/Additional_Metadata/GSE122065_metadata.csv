11/2/18,GSE122065,MS2-affinity purification coupled with RNA sequencing (MAPS) reveals S. aureus RsaI sRNA targetome,"The virulon of Staphyloccocus aureus is controlled by intricate connections between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators including proteins and small non coding RNAs (sRNAs). Most of the sRNAs regulate gene expression through base-pairings with mRNAs. Here, we have applied and adapted the MS2-affinity purification approach coupled to RNA sequencing (MAPS) to determine the targetome of RsaI sRNA of S. aureus.",HG001,BHI,NA,Delta-RsaI
