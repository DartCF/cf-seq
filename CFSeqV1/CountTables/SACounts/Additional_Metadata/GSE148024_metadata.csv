2/12/21,GSE148024,Molecular reprogramming and phenotype switching in Staphylococcus aureus lead to high antibiotic persistence and affect therapy success,"The goal of this experiment was to analyse transcriptomic changes upon acidic pH-stress in different S. aureus strains, including a high persister clincal isolate CI-1149. In addition we aimed to identify differentally regulated pathways that can be linked to an increased persister phenotype as seen in our clinical strain.","Cowan, USA300, Clinical isolates",DMEM,Altered pH,NA,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE148024
