2022/11/22,GSE211771,"Functional characterization of TetR-like transcriptional regulator PA3973 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [RNA-seq]","Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human opportunistic pathogen, is a common cause of nosocomial infections. Its ability to survive under different conditions relies on a complex regulatory network engaging transcriptional regulators controlling metabolic pathways and capabilities to efficiently use the available resources. P. aeruginosa PA3973 encodes a putative TetR family transcriptional regulator, with a helix-turn-helix motif involved in DNA binding. We applied transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq), and genome-wide identification of binding sites using ChIP-seq to unravel the biological role of PA3973.",PAO1,L-agar,NA,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE211771
