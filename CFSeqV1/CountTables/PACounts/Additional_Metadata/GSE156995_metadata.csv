8/28/20,GSE156995,Transcriptomic profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 grown in the presence or absence of mucins or mucin-glycans,"We use high-throughput sequencing to profile the response of the opportunistic mucosal pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa to mucins and mucin-glycans from the mucosal niche. We find that P. aeruginosa undergoes a genome-wide phenotypic shift in response to mucins and their attached glycans. Specifically, nearly all virulence pathways are downregulated in response to these host-produced factors. This study provides a framework for understanding how the host environment regulates bacterial function.",PA14,LB,"Mucin, Mucin-glycan",Delta-RetS
