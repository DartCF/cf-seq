2022/01/05,GSE161971,"Condensins are essential for Pseudomonas aeruginosa corneal virulence through their control of phenotypic programs","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant opportunistic pathogen responsible for numerous human infections. Its high pathogenicity resides in a diverse array of virulence factors and an ability to adapt to hostile environments. We report that these factors are tied to the activity of condensins, SMC and MksBEF, which primarily function in structural chromosome maintenance. This study revealed that both proteins are required for P. aeruginosa virulence during corneal infection. The reduction in virulence was traced to broad changes in gene expression. Transcriptional signatures of smc and mksB mutants were largely dissimilar and non-additive, with the double mutant displaying a distinct gene expression profile. Affected regulons included those responsible for lifestyle control, primary metabolism, surface adhesion and biofilm growth, iron and sulfur assimilation, and numerous virulence factors, including type 3 and type 6 secretion systems. The in vitro phenotypes of condensin mutants mirrored their transcriptional profiles and included impaired production and secretion of multiple virulence factors, growth deficiencies under nutrient limiting conditions, and altered c-di-GMP signaling. Notably, c-di-GMP mediated some but not all transcriptional responses of the mutants. Thus, condensins are integrated into the control of multiple genetic programs related to epigenetic and virulent behavior of P. aeruginosa.",PAO1,LB,NA,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE161971
