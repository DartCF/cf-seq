Here, we explored the antibacterial mechanism of DDDY and its potential preservation applications. Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that DDDY mainly affects genes involved in P. aeruginosa membrane transport and amino acid metabolism pathways. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that DDDY had a stronger effect on 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine phospholipid membranes than on 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-lecithin or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol membranes, with high DDDY concentrations displaying stronger efficacy on 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine. Mechanistically, the N-terminal of DDDY first bound to the phospholipid head group, while its C-terminal amino acid residue bound the hydrophobic tail, thereby creating a gap in the membrane when the phospholipids were clustered by hydrogen bonding. Finally, DDDY inhibited the growth of food microorganisms inoculated onto chestnut kernels, suggesting that DDDY is a promising antibacterial agent against multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
