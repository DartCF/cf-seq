9/29/16,GSE81065,The innate immune protein calprotectin promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus interaction,The goal of this study was to determine the impact of metal deprivation (such as the metal deprivation induced by calprotectin treatment) on the physiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa under multiple growth conditions. The RNA-seq analysis was designed to reveal the impact of calprotectin treatment on P. aeruginosa physiology during planktonic growth.,PA14,TSB,Calprotectin,NA
