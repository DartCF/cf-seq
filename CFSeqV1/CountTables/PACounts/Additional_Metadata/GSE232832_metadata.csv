2023/06/15,GSE232832,"Insights into the Synergistic Antibacterial Activity of Silver Nitrate with Potassium Tellurite Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa","To investigate the individual and synergistic antibacterial mechanisms of silver nitrate and potassium tellurite, Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures were exposed to a shock treatment of these metal salts (individually and in combination) at inhibitory concentrations. Differential gene expression was identified by contrasting each metal salt challenge against a PBS-treated control.",ATCC 27853,SWF,metal antibacterials,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE232832
