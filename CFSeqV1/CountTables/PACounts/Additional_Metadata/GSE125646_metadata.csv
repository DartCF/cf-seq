9/23/19,GSE125646,Transcriptional modulation of Quoring-sensing signaling throught QslA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 and PAO1.,"To further determine the origin of the increased virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 compared to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, we report a transcriptomic approach through RNA sequencing. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutioned sistems-based analsis of transcriptomic pathways. The goals of this study are to compare the transcriptomic profile of all 5263 orthologous genes of these nearly two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","PA14, PAO1",LB,NA,NA,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE125646
