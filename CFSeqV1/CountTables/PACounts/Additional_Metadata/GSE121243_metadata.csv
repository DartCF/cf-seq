7/16/19,GSE121243,"RNA-seq for MvfR, RhlR and QscR","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen of humans, most notably those with cystic fibrosis or whose immune systems are compromised. As a global regulator, MvfR,RhlR and QscR have been characterized to control a group of virulence-related factors and quorum sensing (QS) genes in P. aeruginosa, but its detailed molecular regulatory mechanism is largely elusive. To further gain insights into the direct targets of MvfR,RhlR and QscR in viv, this study focused on identifying the potential targets of MvfR,RhlR and QscR directly regulating QS system and other vireulence pathways. We performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) assay that identified 221, 30 and 1 binding sites of MvfR,RhlR and QscR. The direct regulation of these genes by MvfR,RhlR and QscR have been biochemically and genetically verified. The results indicated that MvfR,RhlR and QscR had direct and profound effects on QS, which provides new cues to better understand the detailed regulatory networks of virulence.",PAO1,LB,NA,"Delta-MvfR, Delta-RhlR, Delta-QscR"
