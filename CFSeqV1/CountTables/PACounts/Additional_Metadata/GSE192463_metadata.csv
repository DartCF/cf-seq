2022/01/31,GSE192463,"Transcriptomic analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in response to host antimicrobial peptide S100A12","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, which is the major cause of corneal infections in India and worldwide. Being categorised in the critical group of antibiotic resistant species, it has prompted significance rise in research to develop alternative therapeutics. One such alternative to combat bacterial infections is antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). This study aims to investigate the role of S100A12, a host defence peptide against PAO1. It was also seen to inhibit the bacterial growth of PAO1 in vitro as seen from the colony forming units. Our study sheds light on how S100A12 impacts Pseudomonas and that it might have the potential to be used as therapeutic intervention in addition to antibiotics in future.",PAO1,NA,S100A12,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE192463
