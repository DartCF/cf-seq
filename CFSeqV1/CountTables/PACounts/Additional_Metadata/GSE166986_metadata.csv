2/18/21,GSE166986,The DEAD-box RNA helicases RhlE2 is a global regulator of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lifestyle and pathogenesis,"Purpose: We wanted to determine the transcriptome profile of PAO1 wild type, PAO1ΔrhlE1, PAO1ΔrhlE2 and PAO1ΔrhlE1ΔrhlE2 mutants on swarming conditions. Method: Cells were harvested using the RNA bacteria protect solution (QIAGEN). Total RNAs was extracted and purified using Monarch RNA isolation kit (NEB), treated with DNase I (Promega) three times to remove contaminating genomic DNA and re-purified again using phenol-chloroform. The removal of ribosomal RNA was performed using the Ribo-Zero Bacteria Kit (Illumina) and cDNA libraries were generated with the ScriptSeq v2 Kit (Illumina) . The samples were sequenced in single end mode on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 device and mRNA reads were trimmed and mapped to the NC_002516.2(PAO1) reference genome from NCBI using Stampy pipeline with defaut settings.",PAO1,MMP,NA,"Delta-rhlE1, Delta-rhlE2","https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE166986
