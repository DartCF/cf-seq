2021/12/31,GSE178622,"Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of control of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and DATS-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 Transcriptomes","Purpose: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling of control of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (RNA-seq) to transcriptome profiling of DATS-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 and to evaluate protocols for optimal high-throughput data analysis. Methods:LB medium (50 mL) was inoculated with exponential growth phase P. aeruginosa PAO1 at a concentration of 1.0E8 CFU/mL. Diallyl trisulfide was then added at a concentration of either 0 (control) or 0.63 μl/mL, respectively, in triplicate. All nine experiment groups were incubated in a water bath shaker at 37 ºC with a shaking rate of 180 rpm for 5 h. Cells were then sampled and centrifuged from the three control groups and three farnesol treatment groups, respectively. The cell precipitates were separately snap-frozen at -80ºC. Total RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol (Life Technologies, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Results: The transcriptome sequencing data of control and DATS-treated groups were compared and analyzed in the form of the following: control vs DATS. The details of the differentially expressed genes among the two groups showed that the amount of differential expressed genes between control group and DATS-treated group was high (total 5572, up-regulated 929, down-regulated 1432).
