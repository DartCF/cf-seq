12/16/20,GSE163248,Dkstatin-treated Pseudomonas aeruginosa trascriptome,"To extract total RNA, P. aeruginosa PAO1 was incubated for 2 h in 5 ml of LB with vigorous shaking at 37°C. Then, additional incubation was conducted for 1 h under the same condition with 150 𝜇M of Dkstatin-1 or Dkstatin-2 supplement. Total RNA samples were extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), and total DNA was eliminated using RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The extraction was performed as an experimental duplicate. Transcriptome profile comparison and processing the expression data were provided by Ebiogen (Korea). RNA quality was assessed by an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands), and RNA quantification was performed using an ND-2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Inc., DE, USA). For control and testing RNAs, rRNA was removed using a Ribo-Zero Magnetic kit (Epicentre Inc., USA) from each 5 ug of total RNA. The construction of a library was performed using a SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq Kit (Clontech Lab Inc., CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. T",PAO1,LB,"Dkstatin1, Dkstatin2",NA
