P. aeruginosa uses a cell-cell signaling mechanism called quorum sensing (QS) to regulate many virulence functions. One type of QS consists of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals produced by LuxI-type signal synthases, which bind a cognate LuxR-type transcription factor. In laboratory strains and conditions, P. aeruginosa employs two AHL synthase/receptor pairs arranged in a hierarchy, with the LasI/R system controlling the RhlI/R system and many downstream virulence factors. However, P. aeruginosa isolates with inactivating mutations in lasR are frequently isolated from chronic CF infections. We and others have shown that these isolates frequently use RhlR as the primary QS regulator. RhlR is rarely mutated in CF and environmental settings. We were interested if there were reproducible genetic characteristics of these isolates and if there was a central group of genes regulated by RhlR in all isolates. We examined five isolates and found signatures of adaptation common to CF isolates. Here, we analyzed CF clinial isolate E104. In this strain, RhlR positively regulates 48 genes, including those coding for known virulence factors. These results suggest a key group of QS-regulated factors important for pathogenesis of chronic infection, and position RhlR as a target for anti-QS therapeutics. Our work underscores the need to sample a diversity of isolates to understanding QS beyond what has been described in laboratory strains.",E104,LB+MOPS,NA,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE198534
