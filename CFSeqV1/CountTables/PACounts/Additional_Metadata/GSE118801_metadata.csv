8/21/18,GSE118801,Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of control of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and diallyl disulphide-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 Transcriptomes,Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized systems-based analysis of cellular pathways. The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling of control of P. aeruginosa PAO1 (RNA-seq) to transcriptome profiling of diallyl disulphide-treated P. aeruginosa PAO1 and to evaluate protocols for optimal high-throughput data analysis.,PAO1,LB,Diallyl disulphide,NA
