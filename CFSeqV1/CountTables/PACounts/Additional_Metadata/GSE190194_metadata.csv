2022/08/31,GSE190194,"The polyaminoisoprenyl compound NV716 re-sensitizes antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa by perturbing outer membrane permeability and reduces bacterial virulence.","Objective: to determine the changes in transcriptome induced by exposure during 52 successive passages of PAO1 to membrane-active agents, namely colistin (CST), alexidine (ALE) and NV716, an investigation polyamino-isoprenic compound Methods: PAO1 was exposed during 50 passages to each of these agents at 1/2 MIC, after which , cells were harvested, and RNA was purified and analyzed by RNAseq Results: upregulations of genes involved in lipidA/LPS synthesis as well as downrelgulation of genes involved in virulence were observed with NV716. Changes in genes related to LipidA and LPS synthesis were also observed with the other agents. Conclusion: Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of action of NV716 and potential targets in P. aeruginosa.",PAO1,NA,colistin,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE190194
