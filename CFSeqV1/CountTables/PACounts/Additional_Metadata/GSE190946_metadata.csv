2022/05/30,GSE190946,"Transcriptomic response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Z154 planktonic cultures to N-acetylcysteine exposure.","N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a mucolytic agent commonly administered together with antibiotics for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections, which has been demonstrated to exert also an antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against relevant respiratory pathogens. We analysed the transcriptomic response of P. aeruginosa planktonic cultures to NAC exposure (at concentration achievable by the inhalation route of administration).",Z154,MHB,NAC,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE190946
