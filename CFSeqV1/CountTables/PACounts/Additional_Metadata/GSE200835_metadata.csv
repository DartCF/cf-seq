In this study, a P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutant strain with deletion of multiple QS elements and inducible expression of PqsE and/or RhlR has been generated and validated. RNA-seq performed in this genetic background allowed to unambiguously define the regulons controlled by PqsE and RhlR when produced alone or in combination Data produced in this study demonstrate that PqsE mainly impacts on the P. aeruginosa transcriptome via an RhlR-dependent pathway, and splits the RhlR-regulon in PqsE-dependent and PqsE-independent sub-regulons.",PAO1,LB,"L-arabinose,IPTG",NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE200835
