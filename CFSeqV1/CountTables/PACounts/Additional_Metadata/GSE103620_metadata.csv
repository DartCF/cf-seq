7/1/18,GSE103620,Effect of Rosmarinic acid in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 at expression level,"We report a next-generation sequencing of total RNA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 grown in presence of rosmarinic acid (RA) 100mM. Data analysis in comparison with cells grown in absence of RA revealed that the plant compound RA induces a broad transcriptional response in this bacterium, quite similar to the quorum sensing response.",PAO1,LB,Rosmarinic Acid,NA
