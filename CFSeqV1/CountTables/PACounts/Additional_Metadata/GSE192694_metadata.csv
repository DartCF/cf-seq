2022/12/06,GSE192694,"Transcriptional profiling of Pseudomonas aeruginosa WT and Pho mutant colony biofilms in response to ethanol and Candida albicans","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen frequently isolated from co-infections with Candida albicans and other ethanol-producing organisms. We found that ethanol, including that produced by C. albicans, stimulates the PhoB regulon in P. aeruginosa. We identify a subset of PhoB-regulated genes as differentially expressed in response to ethanol which are slightly different than the set of genes with increased expression in a genetically induced low phosphate response via pstB mutation.",PA14,NA,C.Albicans co-culture,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE192694
