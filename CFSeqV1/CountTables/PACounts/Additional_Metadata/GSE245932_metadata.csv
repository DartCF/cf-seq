2024/01/01,GSE245932,"ribosome frofiling with or without 16 mg/L azithromycin treated in pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14","Azithromycin binds to the nascent peptide exit tunnel (NPET) close to the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) of the ribosome, which obstructs the NPET and subsequently induces ribosome stalling and depletion of intracellular pools of tRNAs. To understand the mechanism through which azithromycin represses the transcription of mutation promoting genes, we utilized ribosome profiling to analyze azithromycin caused redistribution of ribosomes on the cellular mRNAs. Wild type PA14 was treated with 16 mg/L azithromycin for 3 hours.",UCBPP-PA14,NA,azithromycin,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE245932
