1/2/20,GSE142464,Pseudomonas aeruginosa core metabolism exerts a widespread growth-independent control on virulence,"Gene expression analysis of highly vs. lowly pathogenic P. aeruginosa strains identifies many virulence factors and only a few metabolism genes related to virulence. Functional transcriptomics re-analysis of core metabolism at the pathway level, reveals amino-acid, succinate, citramalate, and chorismate biosynthesis and beta-oxidation as important for full virulence and expression of these pathways indicative of virulence in various strains.","PA14, MTB-1, B136-33, CF5, C3719, PACS2",LB,NA,NA
