6/4/20,GSE130190,"Genomic, transcriptomic, and structural analysis of Pseudomonas virus PA5oct highlights the molecular complexity among Jumbo phages","Pseudomonas virus PA5oct has a large, linear, double-stranded DNA genome (286,783 bp) and is related to Escherichia phages 121Q/PBECO 4, Klebsiella phage vB_KleM-RaK2, Klebsiella phage K64-1, and Cronobacter phage vB_CsaM_GAP32. A protein-sharing network analysis highlights the conserved core genes within this clade. Combining hybrid genome sequencing, RNA-Seq and mass spectrometry analyses of its virion proteins allowed us to accurately identify genes and elucidate regulatory elements for this phage (ncRNAs, tRNAs and promoter elements). In total PA5oct encodes 449 CDS of which 93, have been identified as virion-associated based on ESI-MS/MS. The RNA-Seq-based temporal genome organization suggests a gradual take-over by viral transcripts from 21%, 69%, and 93%  at 5, 15 and 25 min after infection, respectively . Like many large phages, PA5oct is not organized into contiguous regions of temporal transcription. However, although the temporal regulation of the PA5oct genome expression reveals specific genome clusters expressed in early and late infection, many genes encoding experimentally observed structural proteins surprisingly appear to remain almost untranscribed throughout the infection cycle. Within the host, operons associated with elements of a cryptic Pf1-like prophage are upregulated, as are operons responsible for Psl exopolysaccharide (pslE-J) and periplasmic nitrate reductase (napA-F) production. The characterization described here represents a crucial step towards understanding the genomic complexity as well as molecular diversity of jumbo viruses.",PAO1,LB,PA5Oct Phage Exposure,NA,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130190
