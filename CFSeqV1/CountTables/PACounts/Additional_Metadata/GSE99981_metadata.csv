12/31/17,GSE99981,Next generation sequencing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in the presence of Copper Nanoparticles Stress,"The intensive use of metal-based nanoparticles results in their continuous release into the environment and the subsequent destroying microbial biodiversity and causing occurrence of antibiotic resistant determinants. Although previous studies have indicated that nanoparticles may be toxic to microorganisms, there is a scarcity of data available to assess the underlying molecular mechanisms of inhibitory and biocidal effects of nanoparticles on microorganisms, which is a critical gap in our comprehensive understanding of the impacts of nanoparticles on microbial ecosystems.",PAO1,TSB,CuO NP,NA
