2023/07/01,GSE223663,"The dual GGDEF/EAL domain enzyme PA0285 is a Pseudomonas species housekeeping phosphodiesterase regulating early attachment and biofilm architecture","Bacterial lifestyles are dictated by the conditions encountered during colonization of a specific ecological niche or host. A wide range of environmental stimuli triggers sensory modules, that modify activity of proteins, or/and initiate a transfer of information in complex regulatory networks, which modulate gene expression, and therefore adaptation. The transition between planktonic and biofilm growth is dependent on the homeostasis of the intracellular second messenger c-di-GMP. High c-di-GMP levels driven by diguanylate cyclase (DGC) activity favor biofilm while low levels maintained by phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes encourage planktonic style or biofilm dispersal. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa over 40 PDE/DGC are involved in c-di-GMP homeostasis, including 16 dual enzymes possessing both canonical DGC and PDE motifs, i.e. GGDEF and EAL, respectively. It has been previously reported that the deletion of the PDE/DGC dual enzyme PA0285, one of 5 c-di-GMP-related enzymes conserved across all Pseudomonas species, impacts biofilms and causes elevated c-di-GMP levels in P. aeruginosa. Here we confirm that this role is conserved in various P. aeruginosa (PAO1, PA14 and PAK) and Pseudomonas putida strains. Deletion of PA0285 has the highest impact during the early stage of surface colonization, and RNA-seq analysis in biofilm context indicates that it may be associated with upregulation of cupA fimbrial genes. We demonstrate that the C-terminal portion of PA0285 encompassing the GGDEF and EAL domains binds the respective GTP (GGDEF) and c-di-GMP (EAL) substrates but only exhibits PDE activity in vitro. Both GGDEF and EAL domains are important for PA0285 PDE activity in vivo as suggested by site-directed mutants in each of the key motifs. Complementation of the PA0285 mutant strain with the C-terminal GGDEF/EAL portion in trans is not as effective as with the full-length gene suggesting that the transmembrane region and PAS domains contained in PA0285â€™s N-terminal portion influence its PDE activity in vivo. We speculate that the transmembrane portion or/and PAS domains of PA0285 impede its PDE activity in vivo through modulating the conformation of the enzyme, as shown for P. aeruginosa RbdA, in response to an unknown stimulus.",PAO1,ABTG,NA,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE223663
