2022/03/27,GSE199323,"RNA sequencing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phoenix colonies, viable but non-culturable colonies (VBNCs), and control samples","We report RNA sequencing data for mRNA transcripts obtained from tobramycin exposed phoenix colonies, VBNCs, and various controls (untreated lawn, edge of the zone of clearance of tobramycin, treated outer background lawn). Extracted mRNA was sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 4000, mapped to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 reference genome, and processed to obtain counts for all gene transcripts for each sample. This is the first sequencing data generated for Pseudomonas aeruginosa phoenix colonies and VBNCs.",PAO1,NA,Tobramycin,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE199323
