5/1/17,GSE86211,"CmrA, a novel transcription regulator involved in the multidrug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa",Purpose: Recently we have characterize 43 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa overproducing the efflux pump MexEF-OprN. About 45% of these strains did not display mutations in any of the regulators known to control mexEF-oprN expression. Here we identified a novel regulator of the efflux operon mexEF-oprN that we named CmrA by characterizing in vitro selected mutants from the strain PA14.,"PA14, PJ01",Mueller-Hinton Broth,NA,Delta-mexT
