2023/09/27,GSE227677,"The phage-encoded protein PIT2 impacts bacterial quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by direct interaction with LasR","Quorum sensing (QS) is the cell density-dependent virulence factor regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we elucidate PIT2, a phage-encoded inhibitor of the QS regulator LasR, derived from the lytic Pseudomonas phage LMA2. PIT2 inhibits the effectors PrpL and LasA of the type 2 secretion system of P. aeruginosa and attenuates bacterial virulence towards HeLa cells and in Galleria mellonella. Using RNAseq-based differential gene expression analysis, the effect of PIT2 on the LasR regulatory network was revealed. Moreover, the specific interaction between LasR and PIT2 was determined. These data expand our knowledge on phage-encoded modulators of the bacterial metabolism, as this examples an anti-virulence protein derived from a lytic phage. From an applied perspective, this phage protein reveals and exploits an interesting anti-virulence target in P. aeruginosa. As such, it lays the foundation for a new phage-inspired anti-virulence strategy to combat multidrug resistant pathogens and opens the door for SynBio applications.",PAO1,LB,PIT2,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE227677
