3/1/21,GSE155982,Burkholderia cenocepacia K56-2 transcriptomic profile during the early contacts with surface of host bronchial epithelial cells,"In this work, high-throughput RNA sequencing was used to assess transcriptomic alteration in Burkholderia cenocepacia K56-2 in the early stages of interaction with host-cell surface. Giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) from 16HBE14o- bronchial epithelial cell line were produced and used as a cell-like alternative. RNAseq was performed and the expression of the adherent (GPMV-attached) and non-adherent (planktonic control) bacteria were compared. Using a fold change cut off of â‰¥ 1.5 (adjusted P-value < 0.01), the obtained RNAseq dataset indicates a total of 926 genes which expression was altered upon bacteria-GPMV contact. The sensing of host membranes lead to a transcriptional shift that cause a cascade of metabolic and physiological adaptations to the host specific environment. Many of the differentially expressed genes encode proteins related with central metabolic pathways, transport systems, cellular processes, and virulence traits.",K56-2,LB,Adhesion to bronchial epithelial cell-derived vesicles,NA,Burkholderia cenocepacia,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE155982
