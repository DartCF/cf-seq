4/27/16,GSE77970,"Comparison of the transcriptomes of a Burkholeria pseudomallei bprR [bpss0688] mutant, a bprS [bpss0687] mutant and a bprRS double mutant with the wild-type B. pseudomallei K96243 parent strain.","Objectives: The Burkholderia pseudomallei bprR and bprS genes are predicted to encode the response regulator and sensor kinase components respectively of a two component signal transduction system. Inactivation of either single component of this two component signal transduction system led to attenuation of B. pseudomallei virulence and also reduced motility. However, inactivation of both components resulted in wild-tpe virulence and motility. Therefore, we used RNA-seq to compare the transcritptomes of the three mutant strains (bprR single, bprS single, bprRS double mutant) with the wild-type parent strain in order to identify the genes differenty regulated in the different mutants.",K96243,LB,NA,"bprR, bprS",Burkholderia pseudomallei
