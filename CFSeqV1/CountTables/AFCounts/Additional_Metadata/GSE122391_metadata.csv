9-Dec-18,GSE122391,Transcriptomics analysis of Aspergillus fumigatus co-cultivated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"We report a study conducted to investigate the variation on gene expression of the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus upon co-cultivation with the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The study was conducted by investigating the gene expression variation at different time points (45, 90 and 180 minutes after co-incubation). As control, we used data obtained by cultivating the fungus either without bacteria, or with heat-inactivated Pseudomonas.",A1163,Minimal Medium,Pseudomonas aeruginosa Exposure ,NA,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE122391
