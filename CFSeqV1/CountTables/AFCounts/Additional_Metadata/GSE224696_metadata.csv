2023/11/16,GSE224696,"Fludioxonil-induced differential gene expression in Aspergillus fumigatus and its DtcsC and Dskn7 mutants","The antifungal compound fludioxonil targets the fungal specific group III hybrid histidin kinaseTcsC of A. fumigatus, which in turn activate the High Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) pathway and leads to drastic swelling of the fungal cells. We investigated the different responses of the AfS35 (wild type), the completely resistant mutant strain DtcsC and the partial resistant mutant strain Dskn7 to fludioxonil.","AfS35,DtcsC,Dskn7",liquid AMM,fludioxonil,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE224696
