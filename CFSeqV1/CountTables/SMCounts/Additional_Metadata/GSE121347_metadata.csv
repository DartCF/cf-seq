10/17/18,GSE121347,Stenotrophomonas maltophilia FLR19 response to pH,"We sought to determine how a cystic fibrosis isolate of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia responds to relevant pH gradients (pH 5, 7, and 9) by growing the bacterium in phosphate buffered media and conducting RNAseq experiments. Our data suggests acidic conditions are stressful for strain FLR19, as it responded by increasing expression of stress-response and antibiotic-resistance genes.",FLR19,Todd-hewiitt broth,Variable pH,NA
