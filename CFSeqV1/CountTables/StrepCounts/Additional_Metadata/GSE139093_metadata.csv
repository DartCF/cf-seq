10/19/19,GSE139093,The impact of depletion of iron or manganese on the transcriptome of Streptococcus mutans,"Iron and manganese are micronutrientients that serve as important co-factors necessary for enzymatic function. In the host environment, access to metals can be highy restricted. Here, we wanted to identify the transcriptomic response when S. mutans UA159 is grown in media depleted of iron, manganese, or both.",UA159,FMC,"Iron depletion, Manganese depletion",NA,Streptococcus mutans,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139093
