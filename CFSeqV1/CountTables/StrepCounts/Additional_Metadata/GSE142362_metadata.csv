6/1/21,GSE142362,Transcriptomic comparison of D39 WT and SPD_0588 deletion mutant in Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 with 1 µg/ml methionine,"metR (SPD_0588) mutant (TH9197) cannot grow in chemically defined medium (CDM) without methionine and had significant growth defect in CDM with 1 µg/ml methionine. With the increasing concentration of mehtionine, the growth of TH9197 was restored and the growth of metR mutant is as same as D39 WT (TH4306) when the concentration of methionine reaches 50 µg/ml. SPD_0588 is a putative transcriptional regulator and is homologous to MetR in Streptococcus mutans (78.9 % amino acid identity), which regulates both methionine synthesis and transport. We compared the transcriptome of WT and metR mutant in CDM with 1 µg/ml methionine by RNA-seq to see if MetR regulates the metabolism of methionine in Streptococcus pneumoniae D39. We also want to identify the regulon of SPD_0588.","D39, TH4306, TH9197 - antibiotic resistance",CDM,NA,Delta-metR,Streptococcus pneumoniae
