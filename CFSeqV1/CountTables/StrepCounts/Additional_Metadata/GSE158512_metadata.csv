1/31/21,GSE158512,The CovR environmental sensor orchestrates competence bimodality in salivarius streptococci ,"In bacteria, phenotypic heterogeneity rescues the need for diversity in isogenic populations and allow concomitant multiple survival strategies when choosing only one is too risky. This powerful tactic is exploited for competence in streptococci and results in a bimodal activation, where only a subset of the community triggers the system. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying this puzzling behavior has remained challenging, especially since its study has been mainly achieved in S. mutans, where two different but interconnected regulation networks control competence. In this work, we sought to determine the origin of bimodality associated to the ComRS system thanks to the simplified S. salivarius model that harbors no supplemental signaling system. Using a single cell fluorescence reporter system together with the overexpression of the main actors of the regulation network, we showed that the ComR intracellular concentration is directly linked to the proportion of competent cells in the population. We report that this type of activation requires a functional positive feedback loop acting on comS through Opp and a putative ComS exporter, PptAB. To determine the origin of the heterogeneity amplified by the loop, we developed a mathematical model suggesting that either noise on ComS or ComR abundance could explain bimodality. Because ComR abundance is central for competence bimodal activation, we conducted an in silico identification and a systematic deletion of all the Two Component Systems (TCS) present in S. salivarius and identified CovRS, a well described virulence regulator in GAS and GBS, as a repressor of comR transcription. In vitro direct binding of CovR with the promoter of comR and transcriptomics confirmed those data. As CovRS integrates environmental stimuli that control ComR intracellular concentration, it represents the missing puzzle piece bridging environmental conditions and competence (bimodal) activation in salivarius streptococci.  ",HSISS4,CDM,NA,Delta-covR,Streptococcus salivarius
