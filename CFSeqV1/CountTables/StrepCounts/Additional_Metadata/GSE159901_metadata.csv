The molecular mechanism for this heightened antimicrobial activity was identified through transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of a wild type strain and a zinc efflux mutant to identify cellular targets of zinc intoxication. This revealed that zinc intoxication induces numerous cellular disruptions, which when combined with frontline antibiotics, can break antibiotic resistance and potentially preclude further resistance from emerging.",D39,C+Y media,Zinc,NA,Streptococcus pneumoniae,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE159901
