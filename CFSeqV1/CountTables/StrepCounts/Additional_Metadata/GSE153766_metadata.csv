7/4/20,GSE153766,Transcriptomic analysis of Streptococcus suis in response to ferrous iron and cobalt toxicity,"We explored the transcriptome change of Streptococcus suis in the presence of ferrous iron and cobalt by RNA sequencing. The data revealed that expression of a lot of genes was altered to respond to ferrous iron and cobalt toxicity. Moreover, most of the genes differentially expressed in response to cobalt are the same as those in response to ferrous iron.",SC19,Tryptic soy broth ,"Ferrous Iron, Cobalt",NA,Streptococcus suis,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE153766
