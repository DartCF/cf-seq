2023/11/08,GSE243041,"Physiologic and Transcriptomic Effects Triggered by Overexpression of Wild Type and Mutant DNA Topoisomerase I in Streptococcus pneumoniae","We obtained the topARA mutant that encodes a TopoI enzyme that shows reduced topoisomerase activity compared to the wild type gene (topAWT) and confers resistance to the antibiotic seconeolitsine. Alterations in the gene expression profile produced after overexpression of the wild type or the RA mutant of topA gene were studied. In addition, differential gene expression produced by the DNA gyrase inhibitor novobiocin (NOV) was also studied in cultures overexpressing each of the versions of TopA.",NA,AGCH,novobiocin,NA,Streptococcus pneumoniae,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE243041
