8/19/19,GSE120640,Molecular singularities in a pheromone sensor triumvirate desynchronize the competence-predation interplay in the human commensal Streptococcus salivarius,"The human oral cavity is one of the most competing environments, considering the extent and diversity of the bacterial community that colonizes it, as well as the multiple stresses to which it is subjected. The commensal species Streptococcus salivarius is one of the first colonizers of the oral mucosa (tongue, gums, inner cheeks and tooth enamel) in infants and remains predominant throughout the life of an adult. In order to adapt to diverse and variable environmental conditions, S. salivarius triggers in a coordinated way two bacterial developmental processes: competence (acquisition of extracellular DNA and new genetic traits) and predation (secretion of cytotoxic molecule), via ComR, a transcription factor activatable by a ""pheromone"" peptide. Nevertheless, the activation of other transcriptional regulators can uncouple these 2 mechanisms to allow, for example, only the production of toxins without triggering the competence phase.",HSISS4,CDMG,NA,"Delta-scuR, Delta-sarF, scuR-Overproducer, sarF-Overproducer",Streptococcus salivarius
