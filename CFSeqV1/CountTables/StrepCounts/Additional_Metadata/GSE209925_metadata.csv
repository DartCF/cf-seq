2022/08/03,GSE209925,"Interactions with Commensal or Non-commensal Streptococci Alter Streptococcus mutans Transcriptome and Behaviors","RNA-Seq was used to compare the transcriptome of Streptococcus mutans UA159 during growth alone in monoculture, in coculture with Streptococcus gordonii DL1, Streptococcus sanguinis SK36 or Streptococcus oralis 34, and in a quadculture containing all four species. Individual cultures of commensal species Streptococcus gordonii DL1, Streptococcus sanguinis SK36 and Streptococcus oralis 34 were sequenced as well. This revealed a common transcriptome pattern in S. mutans when grown in mixed-species culture, indepenedent of the species identity that S. mutans was cultured with. Additionally, transcriptome changes in the commensal species could also be determined when undergoing competition from S. mutans. RNA-Seq was used to compare the transcriptome of Streptococcus mutans UA159 during growth alone in monoculture or in coculture with Streptococcus sobrinus NIDR 6715, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646 or Corynebacterium matruchotii ATCC 14266. These data were compared to previous coculture and quadculture RNA-Seq data with commensal streptococci (GSE209925). These data confirmed a common transcriptome pattern in S. mutans when grown in mixed-species culture with commensal streptococci that is not present with non-commensal streptococci, indepenedent of the species identity that S. mutans was cultured with.",UA159,TYG,NA,NA,Streptococcus sanguinis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE209925
