6/15/19,GSE132733,Identifying the regulon of Two Component System 7 (SPD_0157 and SPD_0158) of Streptococcus pneumoniae,"By comparing the transcriptome of Streptococcus pneumoniae wild-type D39 (serotype 2) to an isogenic strain overexpressing the response regulator of Two-Component System 7 (SPD_0158), we identified the regulon of the two-component system. In total 20 and 24 genes were considered up- and downregulated, respectively. 11 of the upregulated genes encode for proteins involved in host-glycan metabolism, while 7 encode proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Most downregulated genes encode competence genes, but later experiments proved this was likely due to an atefact of overexpression. The remaining genes encode genes with other functions.",D39,C+Y Medium,NA,SPD_0158-Overproducer,Streptococcus pneumoniae,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132733
