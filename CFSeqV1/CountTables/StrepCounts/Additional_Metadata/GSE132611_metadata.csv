6/13/19,GSE132611,RNA-Sequencing of S. pneumoniae when exposed to the bacteriophage SpSL1,"mRNA was sequenced in triplicate in three time points to determine the global transcriptional response of S. pneumoniae that is susceptible to the bacteriophage SpSL1. Samples were taken from mid log exponential phase in standard glucose contaiing media with an MOI of 0.2 at three time points: 10 minutes, 50 minutes, and 90 minutes post infection.",D39,CAT-Galactose,Bacteriophage SpSL1,NA,Streptococcus pneumoniae,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132611
