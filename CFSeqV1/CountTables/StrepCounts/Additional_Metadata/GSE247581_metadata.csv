2023/11/18,GSE247581,"A study on the impact of the absence of the NIP or NrpR gene on gene expression of Streptococcus salivarius K12 (SAL)","NIP and NrpR forms a pair for the transcriptional regulator in Streptococcus salivarius K12 (SAL). To explore the target genes regulated by the NIP-NrpR pair in Streptococcus salivarius K12 (SAL), we generated mutants in which the NIP or NrpR gene has been knocked down through complement recombination. Comparative transcriptome profiling of WT, â–²nrpR, and nip* mutant strains revealed that the sar BGC is the major regulatory target controlled by the NIP signaling pathway in SAL.",K12,THY medium,NA,NA,Streptococcus salivarius,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE247581
