4/10/14,GSE54199,Transcriptome and marker frequency analysis of E. coli (control vs. Trimethoprim) and S. pneumoniae (control vs. HPUra/Kanamycin),"We show that treatment with HPUra (for S. pneumoniae) and trimethoprim (for E. coli) leads to a skewed gene dosage profile (increase around the origin of replication), which is also propagated to the transcriptome level. Kanamycin, however, does not have this effect. In case of S. pneumoniae this shift in gene dosage distribution leads to the population-wide activation of competence.",D39,C plus Y medium,"HPUra, Kanamycin",NA,Streptococcus pneumoniae,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE54199
