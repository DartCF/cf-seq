4/26/19,GSE129572,Analysis of the transcriptome of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron during growth on complex N-glycan as the sole carbon source,The goal of this project was to sequence the transcriptome of wild type Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 grown in minimal media with either glucose or bovine alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (AAGP) as the sole carbon source. Using these data we could then compare relative gene expression levels under each condition and identify genes specifically upregulated during growth on AAGP. Analysis of the spent media indicated that only the N-glycan component of the AAGP had been used by the cells to support growth.,VPI-5482,Minimal Medium,"Glucose, Bovine alpha 1 acid glycoprotein - AAGP",NA,Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE129572
