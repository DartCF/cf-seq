3/6/21,GSE168352,Functional dissection of the PTS provides insight into the prevalence of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the host intestinal environment,"Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is a dominant member of healthy human colon microbiota, regarded as a beneficial gut bacterium due to its ability to produce anti-inflammatory substances. However, little is known about how F. prausnitzii utilizes the nutrients present in the human gut, influencing its prevalence in the host intestinal environment. The phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a widely distributed and highly efficient carbohydrate transport system found in most bacterial species that catalyses the simultaneous phosphorylation and import of cognate carbohydrates; its components play physiological roles through interaction with other regulatory proteins. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of the 16 genes encoding putative PTS components (2 enzyme I, 2 HPr, and 12 enzyme II components) in F. prausnitzii A2-165. We identified the general PTS components responsible for the PEP-dependent phosphotransfer reaction and the sugar-specific PTS components involved in the transport of two carbohydrates, N-acetylglucosamine and fructose, among five enzyme II complexes. We suggest that the dissection of the functional PTS in F. prausnitzii may help to understand how this species outcompetes other bacterial species in the human intestine.",A2-165,YCFA,"Galactose, Fructose, Glucose, N-acetylglucosamine",NA
