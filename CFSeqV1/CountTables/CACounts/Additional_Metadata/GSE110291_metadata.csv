6/7/19,GSE110291,Characterization of a Candida albicans Isolated from a recurrent Cervical Lymphadenitis Patient and it’s Clinic Indication,"Purpose: To reveal the global regulatory genes of clinical strain, we performed comparative transcriptomic analyses of the SC5314 and JL01.Methods: We isolated a clinical Candida albicans strain JL01 (Jinling Hospital in Nanjing, China) from a 21-year-old man who presented to our hospital with recurrent cervical lymphadenitis. Cells of the JL01 and SC5314 were inoculated from overnight cultures by 1% into liquid YPD plus 10% serum medium at 37°C for 3 h. Cells were collected and total RNA was extracted as described. RNA-Seq analysis was performed by the company Majorbio (Shanghai, China). mRNA was purified, fragmented and used to synthesize cDNA. The library products were sequenced on the HiSeq 4000 platform using the HisSeq 4000 PE Cluster Kit and HisSeq 4000 SBS Kit.Results: 421 genes were significantly differentially regulated (P≤0.05, |log2FC|≥1) in JL01 compared with SC5314. Of these 421 DEGs (differentially expressed genes), 216 were up-regulated, and 205 were down-regulated. Conclusions: Together the clinical, morphological and biological analyses, we suggest that azole drug resistance, invasive defect and hypo-virulence of the JL01 strain may correlate with its contribution in chronic fungal infection.","SC5314, Clinical isolate",YPD,NA,NA,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE110291
