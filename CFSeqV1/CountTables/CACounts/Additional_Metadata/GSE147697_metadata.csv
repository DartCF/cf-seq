3/30/20,GSE147697,"Transcriptome analysis uncovers a link between copper metabolism, and both fungal fitness and antifungal sensitivity in the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans","Copper homeostasis is an important determinant for virulence of many human pathogenic fungi such as the highly prevalent yeast Candida albicans. However, beyond the copper transporter Ctr1, little is known regarding other genes or biological process that are affected by copper. To gain insight into the cellular processes that are modulated by copper abundance in C. albicans, we monitored the global gene expression dynamic under both copper depletion and excess using RNA-seq.",SN250,YPD,"Bathocuproine sulfonate - copper starvation, Copper Sulfate - Copper source",Delta-MAC1,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147697
