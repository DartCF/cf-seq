6/30/18,GSE100737,"Transcript levels of genes in the wild type CAI4 as well as the gdt1/gdt1,the pmr1/pmr1 and the gdt1/gdt1 pmr1/pmr1 mutants","We report the expression levels of transcripts of 5,901 genes in log-phase growing cells of the wild type CAI4 as well as the gdt1/gdt1, the pmr1/pmr1, and the gdt1/gdt1 pmr1/pmr1 mutants.We find that as compared to the wild type, there are 249, 446 and 440 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the gdt1/gdt1, the pmr1/pmr1 and the gdt1/gdt1 pmr1/pmr1 mutants, respectively. Deletion of CaGDT1 does not affect the transcript level of CaPMR1, and vice versa. There are 105 shared DEGs between the gdt1/gdt1 and the pmr1/pmr1 mutants, which accounts for 42% (105/249) of total DEGs due to deletion of CaGDT1 or 24% (105/446) of total DEGs due to deletion of CaPMR1.",CAI4,SD-URA,NA,"Delta-gdt1, Delta-pmr1"
