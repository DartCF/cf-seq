6/29/21,GSE158472,Combining Genome-wide Gene Expression Analysis (RNA-seq) and Gene Editing Platform (CRISPR-Cas9) to Uncover the Selectively Pro-oxidant Activity of Aurone Compound against Candida albicans,The antifungal activity of aurones SH1009 and SH9051 against Candida albicans was investigated. A whole-genome transcriptional analysis post aurone SH1009 and SH9051 treatments on the C. albicans SC5314 strain was performed using RNA-seq technique.,SC5314,YPD,"aurone SH1009, aurone SH9051",NA
