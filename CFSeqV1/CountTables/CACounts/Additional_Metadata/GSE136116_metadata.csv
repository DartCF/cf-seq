8/22/19,GSE136116,Global transcriptomic analyses of the candida albicans response to treatment with a novel inhibitor of filamentation,"The opportunistic pathogenic fungus Candida albicans can cause devastating infections in severely compromised patients. Its ability to undergo a morphogenetic transition from yeast to filamentous forms allows it to penetrate tissues and cause damage, and the expression of a number of pathogenetic mechanisms are also coordinately regulated with this yeast-to-hyphae conversion. Therefore, it is widely considered that filamentation represents one of the main virulence factors of C. albicans. We have previously identified N-[3-(allyloxy)-phenyl]-4-methoxybenzamide (compound 9029936) as the lead compound in a series of small molecule inhibitors of C. albicans filamentation, and characterized its activity, both in vitro and in vivo, as a promising candidate for the development of alternative anti-virulence strategies for the treatment of C. albicans infections. Here we have performed RNA sequencing analysis of samples obtained from C. albicans cells grown under filament-inducing conditions in the presence or absence of this compound. Overall treatment with compound 9029936 resulted in 618 up-regulated and 702 down-regulated genes. Not surprisingly some of the top down-regulated genes included well characterized genes associated with filamentation and virulence such as SAP5, ECE1 (candidalysin), and ALS3, as well as genes that impact metal chelation and utilization. Gene ontology analysis revealed an over-representation of cell adhesion, iron transport, filamentation, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis processes among down-regulated genes as result of treatment with this leading compound. Interestingly, the top up-regulated genes pointed to an enhancement of vesicular transport pathways, and in particular SNARE interactions.",SC5314,YPD,Filamentation Inhibitor,NA,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE136116
