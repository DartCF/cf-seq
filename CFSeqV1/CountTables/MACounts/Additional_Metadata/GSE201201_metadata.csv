2022/07/27,GSE201201,"Mycobacterium abscessus HelR interacts with RNA Polymerase to confer intrinsic rifamycin resistance","Using RNA sequencing we show that exposure of M. abscessus to sublethal doses of RIF results in ~25-fold upregulation of Mab_helR; an isogenic deletion mutant of Mab_helR is hypersensitive to RIF and RBT, and over-expression of Mab_helR confers RIF tolerance in M. tuberculosis, implying that Mab_helR constitutes a significant determinant of inducible RIF and RBT resistance.",ATCC19977,Middle brook 7H9,RIF,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE201201
