2022/10/05,GSE214640,"RNAseq expression libraries from Mycobacterium abscessus with deletion of the sRNA B11","WT M. abscessus ATCC_19977 was used to construct a targeted deletion mutant lacking the sRNA B11 and a complemented version of the mutant with ectopic expression of B11 from its native promoter at the L5 site. The deletion mutant was also complemented with versions of B11 that lacked a single C from the first loop or had an extra C in the second loop. All strains were grown to log phase and the extracted RNA was used to perform expression profiling by RNAseq.",ATCC 19977,7H9,NA,NA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE214640
